# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The goal is to visualize accident hotspots and determine contributing factors that can help in understanding accident trends.

### Key Features:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Accident Hotspot Visualization
- Analysis of Contributing Factors: Road Conditions, Weather, and Time of Day

## Dataset

The dataset contains records of traffic accidents with key attributes such as:
- **Accident ID**: Unique identifier for each accident
- **Location**: Coordinates or descriptions of where the accident occurred
- **Time of Day**: Timestamp or categorized time of the accident (e.g., morning, afternoon, night)
- **Weather Conditions**: Information on weather conditions during the accident (e.g., clear, rainy, foggy)
- **Road Conditions**: Data on road conditions at the time of the accident (e.g., dry, wet, icy)
- **Severity**: Severity or impact of the accident (e.g., minor, major, fatal)

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Handle missing or incomplete data fields.
- **Data Formatting**: Ensure consistency in time, date, and location formats.
  
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Accident Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of accidents across different locations.
- **Time of Day Analysis**: Analyze accident trends during different times of the day (e.g., peak hours).
- **Weather and Road Conditions**: Understand how weather and road conditions contribute to accident severity and frequency.

### 3. Accident Hotspot Visualizations
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize accident hotspots on a geographical map.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Identify accident-prone areas using clustering techniques.
- **Contributing Factors**: Analyze the relationship between road conditions, weather, and accident occurrences.

### 4. Accident Severity and Factors
- **Weather and Accident Severity**: Determine how different weather conditions impact the severity of accidents.
- **Time of Day and Accident Frequency**: Visualize accident frequency by time of day.
- **Road Conditions and Severity**: Examine how road conditions (e.g., dry, wet, icy) affect accident severity.
